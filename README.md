<b>How It Works</b> <br>
This project is a Contest Tracker that fetches and displays upcoming and recent programming contests from multiple platforms using the [Clist API](https://clist.by/).<br>

<b>üîß Tech Stack</b> <br>
<b>Frontend:</b> React.js, Tailwind CSS<br>
<b>State Management:</b> Redux Toolkit<br>
<b>API:</b> Clist.by<br>
<b>Deployment:</b> Vercel<br>

<b>‚öôÔ∏è Functionality</b> <br>
<b>1. Fetching Upcoming Contests</b> <br>
On app load, it makes an API call to Clist to fetch <b>upcoming contests</b> across selected platforms (codeforces, leetcode, codechef, atcoder) and stores them in Redux state.<br>
<b>2. Fetching Past Contests (last 60 days)</b> <br>
The app also fetches <b>past contests</b> (filtered between current date and 60 days prior) for each platform separately and merges them into one list.<br>
<b>3. Sorting & Display</b>
<ul>
  <li>Upcoming contests are sorted by start time</li>
  <li>Past contests are sorted by most recent</li>
  <li>The data is displayed using clean UI cards</li>
</ul>
